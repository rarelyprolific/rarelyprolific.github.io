        <h3>About me</h3>
      
        <p>My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/rarelyprolific">Alan Gryniewicz</a> and I'm a software developer from Bristol in the United Kingdom.</p>
      
        <p>I've been playing around with computers since the late eighties and was a proud owner of both a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20">Commodore VIC-20</a>
        and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum +2</a>. I'd like to say I could code back then but, to be honest, I never got much further than:</p>
      
        <pre>
        10 PRINT "HELLO"
        20 GOTO 10
        </pre>
      
        <p>More recently, I finally got the knack of programming.</p>
      
        <p>Currently I work mainly with C#, SQL and web technologies. I'm excited about learning .NET Core and diving into the crazy expanding world of JavaScript. I generally
        relish any opportunity to play around with new technology.</p>

        <p>Additionally, I'm very interested in getting teams of developers working together happily. A hard-working lone software developer can achieve wonders. A small team
        with a positive attitude and synced up like a hive mind can perform miracles!</p>
    
        <h3>About this site</h3>
      
        <p>This site is an on-going collection of my thoughts and notes regarding the current state of software development as I see it. <em>(I'm often wrong!)</em></p>
      
        <p>I'll pull together my technical notes about what I'm currently learning. I'll also comment about which soft skills and techniques I believe work well in a software
        development environment and where I think stuff goes wrong! Nothing too controversial but I reserve the right to be brutally honest.</p>
