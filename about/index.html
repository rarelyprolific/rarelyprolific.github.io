    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p>My name is <strong><a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/alan-gryniewicz-2183182a">Alan Gryniewicz</a></strong> and I'm a self-taught
      <strong>Software Developer and Architect</strong> from the south west of the United Kingdom. I've been working as a professional
      programmer for a couple of decades now.</p>
    
    <p>I was also a <strong>Certified Scrum Master</strong> for a while. I'm very interested in getting teams of developers working together happily. A hard-working
      lone developer can achieve wonders. A small team with a positive attitude and synced up like a hive mind can perform miracles!</p>
    
    <p>I'm always up for learning something new but I'm currently working mainly with <strong>C# .NET</strong>, <strong>Azure</strong> and
      containers (<strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Kubernetes</strong>).</p>
    
    <p>My lifelong obsession with technology began in the late 1980's when I got my hands on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20">Commodore VIC-20</a>.
      This was closely followed by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">Sinclair ZX Spectrum +2</a>. I <em>"typed in"</em> pages of code on both machines,
      although most of it never worked and the syntax was indecipherable to me at that time. Possibly as a result of that.. <em>I played a lot of games!</em> Towards the end
      of the commercial lifetime of the Spectrum I began to discover the European <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene">demoscene</a> and became
      fascinated by the quality of the demos being produced on the now aging hardware.</p>
    
    <p>In the 1990's I had both a Commodore Amiga <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_600">A600</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_1200">A1200</a>.
      Despite <em>still</em> playing copious amounts of games, I couldn't wait to get my hands on some Amiga demos. The Amiga was arguably the flagship demo platform of
      the era.</p>
    
    <p>I even got together with some like-minded individuals and we formed our own demoscene group called <a href="https://demozoo.org/groups/29956/">Area 51</a>.
      We were not elite demo coders by any stretch of the imagination but we did release some productions we were proud of and had some fun times. Our main focus was a disk magazine
      called <a href="https://demozoo.org/productions/235142/">Beyond The Frontier</a> which we created collectively.</p>
    
    <p><strong><em>The Amiga is the best computer in the world!</em></strong></p>
    
    <p>I didn't realise it at the time but getting connected to the Internet in the late 1990's signified the end of my scene activities. Most of the fun in the scene
      was trading floppy disks with contacts via jiffy bags in the post. Waiting for the postman to arrive so you could see if he had brought any new demos and intros,
      as well as sending off your own productions to other guys for spreading. The Internet just gave everyone access to everything overnight. In many ways this is a
      very good thing but it also marked a change for the scene.</p>
    
    <p>Somewhere around the turn of the millennium I finally gave in and bought a PC. I'd been holding out for years as I loved my A1200 and I had it doing everything. It had
      an internal hard drive, 56K modem and was on the Internet.</p>
    
    <p>For many years after that I was just an avid computer user and gamer.</p>
    
    <p>Then I was offered an opportunity. I'd been employed in general office admin roles but it had been noticed that I had an aptitude for working with
      computers. I became a trainee <strong>Systems Administrator and Developer</strong>! This reignited my passion for creating computer software and
      became my full-time occupation.</p>
    
    <p>Ever since that happened, I've continued to keep myself busy learning new skills and immersing myself in technology.</p>
    
    <p>I still have a secret desire to make another demoscene release so I've been lurking in another demoscene group
      called <a href="https://www.neokortex.co.uk">Neokortex</a> for the past few years.</p>
