Modern software development has a bewildering level of choice. Sometimes an opinionated, pre-configured tool can get you coding the stuff
you really want to be working on faster.

This is currently what works for me:

## Development Tools

- **Visual Studio** for C# development.
- **VS Code** (with plugins) for everything else.
- **Docker Desktop** (or another container tool).
- [**k9s**](k9s) for interacting with Kubernetes using a lightning fast terminal based UI.
- [**git**](git) for source control.

## VS Code Plugins

- **markdownlint** to make formatting markdown easy.

## Other

- **Obsidian** for making notes and capturing ideas.
