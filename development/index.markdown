title: Development Notes
layout: post
---

This is an area I'm using to accumulate my notes on coding, different languages and development technologies. I've got scribbles in
various notebooks and, aside from the fact that my handwriting isn't great(!), I want to consolidate it into one, easy to reference
and search resource.

This also means I can keep track of what I've both learnt and am still learning as *(call this a bad habit if you like)* I tend to skip
between subjects which interest me from month to month.
