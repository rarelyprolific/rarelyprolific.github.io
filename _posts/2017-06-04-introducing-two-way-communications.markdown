**⚠️ Update for 2025. Disqus was removed. See [here]({% post_url 2025-09-20-refurbished-for-2025 %}) for more details. ⚠️**

Up until today this blog was missing an important feature.

Here I am putting the world to rights and no one can scream back at me that I'm talking complete rubbish. Now they can because I've integrated comments on my blog
posts using Disqus!

*Well.. I'm hoping I don't get shouted at.*

But it would be nice to know if anyone out there is reading this blog at the moment. I have not made any attempt to publicise this site in any way so far because
I really wanted to get some content on here first and, if I'm honest, prove to myself I would stick with it.

So I would really appreciate it if anyone leaves any comments or feedback. If there are at least a couple of people somewhere in the world who have enjoyed reading
something I have written then it makes the effort more than worthwhile.

Also, I don't expect people to agree with everything I write. I'd like to think I have some good ideas now and again but I'm old enough to know I'm probably being
naive and ignorant when I comment about subjects I don't have much experience with. I do try to keep an open mind though and welcome any alternative views and
constructive criticism.
