*Sometimes you blink and it turns from 2017 to 2025!*

It's fair to say I abandoned this site for a while. Although I kept diligently renewing the domain, the pages
themselves became the literal definition of a static site.

As always, there is no plan yet but you've got to start somewhere and I've started tweaking stuff.

When I originally started this site I had an idea for the logo in my mind. I wanted it to be a tumbleweed blowing
across a desolate landscape in a 16-bit pixel art style. I could picture it but could never draw it. As it turns
out, in the post-covid dystopian reality we now reside within, I can just ask AI to generate it for me. I don't
intend to fill this site with AI slop but it did come in fairly handy for that logo.

I've decided against deleting my old blog posts even though I'm not really sure they stand the test of time. But,
you live and learn.. and cringe!

The last post I made before abandoning this site in 2017 was to announce I had integrated Disqus. With hindsight
I've now realised I would have to add a cookie banner to be compliant with UK law due to the fact that Disqus
sets several cookies which are not strictly necessary for the site to function.

I would like to keep this site clean and without pop ups or dialogs. The simple solution to this was just to
remove Disqus which eliminates the cookie problem and wasn't really being used anyway.

If I suddenly become aware of an influx of people who want a mechanism to engage with my posts on this site I
may reconsider but that particular scenario seems unlikely for the time being.

*Are blog posts still a thing these days or is it all podcasts?*
